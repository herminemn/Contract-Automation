# Contract Automation

In companies employees spend much time to make contracts for partners, customers or their employees. They can sometimes do stupid mistakes by this mechanical work.
This project is aimed to save the time of employees and do the mechanical staff instead of them.
How it works:
 - The employee needs only to keep a contract docx template, where he/she must do some adjustments corresponding to the program prerequisites.
 - By clicking edit the editable fields will appear and the employee will fill them with the needed inputs.
 - By saving the contract a saved version will be kept in the folder.
